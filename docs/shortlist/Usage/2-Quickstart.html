<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>Setting up your first lists with Shortlist is as simple as 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="#step1">Add tags to Add/Remove items</a></li>
	<li><a href="#step2">Add tags to view list contents</a></li>
	<li><a href="#step3">Add tags to control list functions and visibility</a></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="step1">1. Add tags to Add/Remove items</h3>
<p>Shortlist will work with any element in your Craft site. They can be entries, users, assets, tags, completely custom elements. Basically anything with a unqiue element id. (which is almost everything)</p>
<p>First we want to show an add/remove button that respects the current item state (ie. if the item exists in the user's lists right now). We do that like this : </p>



// CODE


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This method of adding/removing items is the simplest and just uses a link. All functions can also be used using form posts if you want to pass dynamic values. (ie. to pass extra fields for items)</p>


<h3 id="#step2">2. Add tags to view list contents</h3>
<p>Once a user has items in their lists you'll want to give them a page to view the items. That's as simple as using the following tags :</p>

// CODE


<p>You can do more with this output if the user has multiple lists. The same concept works for shared and public lists. By default these tags will limit the responses to the current user, by supplying an alternative user or list (and assuming they have correct permissions) you can view other lists too.

<h3 id="#step3">3. Add tags to control list functions and visibility</h3>
<p>Users can have multiple lists, control extra details about their lists and even set the list visibilty and sharing options. All these functions can be controlled simply with a few front-end tags to expose the functions. </p>

<p>Taking your first payment with Charge is as simple as 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#step1">Set your Stripe API Keys</a></li>
	<li><a href="#step2">Add the Payment Form</a></li>
	<li><a href="#step3">Add the Form Javascript</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step1">1. Set your Stripe API Keys</h3>

<p>Stripe has 2 modes you can run in, <strong>Live</strong> and <strong>Test</strong>. Each of the modes has a set of 2 unique keys, called your <strong>Publishable Key</strong> and <strong>Secret Key</strong>. In the Charge Module settings you'll see places to input all of those codes, as well as a toggle to change the stripe mode. </p>

<p>Your API keys are listed in the Stripe control panel, found under [Your Account] > [API Keys].</p>

<h3 id="step2">2. Add the Payment Form</h3>

<p>The payment form is the main part of setting up Charge on your site. This form has a few simple required fields, and a few optional ones which you can use to customize the payments and customer information collected. At it's <em>simplest</em> we need fields for the user's <em>Card</em>, and an amount to take for the payment. </p>

<p>We use the <code><a href="/addons/charge/docs/tags#tag-form">{exp:charge:form}</a></code> tag to wrap up the the form. There are a number of optional parameters you can specify on that tag to alter the default behaviour of Charge.</p>


<p><a href="/addons/charge/docs/tags#tag-form">See what fields you'll need for the payment form.</a></p>

<h3 id="step3">3. Add the Form Javascript</h3>

<p>To take simple card payments, Stripe uses javascript to intercept the form action and create a secure token of the payment card details.</p>

<p>You'll need to include the Stripe javascript library on the payment pages like so : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="<em>{exp:charge:stripe_js}</em>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>And our javascript to take over the form : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="<em>{exp:charge:js}</em>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>And finally, our public key, and specific setup values : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
(function(window, undefined) {
        Stripe.setPublishableKey('<em>{exp:charge:public_key}</em>');
        $(this).<em>charge('#charge-form', '#payment-errors')</em>;
})(window);
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This is the simplest javascript setup, but of course you're able to extend or setup your own usage however you'd like.</p>


<h2>Taking it Further</h2>
<p>This is just the simplest way to use Charge on your site to take Stripe payments. There are lot more options available. <a href="/addons/charge/docs/examples">Have a look at the examples to see what you could do &rarr;</a></p>
