# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I get support?
Email is the best way - just send an email to [support@topshelfcraft.com](mailto:support@topshelfcraft.com).

We're also around in various Slack groups, and on Twitter, but we don't recommend that for general support issues. We're alway happy to help, even if you've just got random questions, but if you contact us via an alternative route other than emailing support, it's highly likely your issue can be missed.
