# Installation

Shortlist is a standard Craft plugin so installation is super simple:

1. Un-zip the Shortlist download and move the `shortlist` directory into your Craft plugins directory (usually `craft/plugins`)
1. In your Craft control panel, go to **Settings** > **Plugins**, find Shortlist in the plugin list, and click **Install**.
1. Optionally check out the Shortlist settings and update any values you might want to change.
