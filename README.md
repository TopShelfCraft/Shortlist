_Lightweight, flexible lists for Craft CMS._

**A [Top Shelf Craft](https://topshelfcraft.com) plugin**

### TL;DR.

Simply put - it's the best way to add user wishlists, favorites, or any user list features, to your Craft build.

Shortlist lets your users add any element type to their lists. Want to just have a list of favourite entries? Done. A list of followed users? Done. A list of favourite assets? Easy as pie. A list of a completely custom element type? No trouble.
